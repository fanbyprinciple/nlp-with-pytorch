# Chapter 2 : A quick tour of traditional nlp

- Natural language processing (NLP, introduced in the previous chapter) and computational linguistics
(CL) are two areas of computational study of human language

### Corpora, Tokens and types

- All NLP methods, be they classic or modern, begin with a text dataset, also called a corpus (plural:
corpora). A corpus usually contains raw text (in ASCII or UTFÂ­8) and any metadata associated with
the text.

-  The raw text is a sequence of characters (bytes), but most times it is useful to group those
characters into contiguous units called tokens.
